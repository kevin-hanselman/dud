A Stage is a group of Artifacts, or an operation that consumes and/or produces
a group of Artifacts. Stages are defined by the user in YAML files and should be
tracked with source control.

Below is a fully-annotated Stage YAML file for reference.

` + "``` yaml" + `
# The checksum of this Stage definition, written during 'dud commit'. This
# checksum is used to determine when a Stage definition has been modified by
# a user. The checksum does not include Artifact checksums.
checksum: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890

# The shell command to run when 'dud run' is called. '/bin/sh' is used to
# run the command. (Stage commands are optional.)
command: python train.py

# The directory in which the Stage's command is executed. Like all paths in
# a Stage definition, it must be a directory path relative to the project's root
# directory. An empty or omitted value means the command is executed in the
# project root directory. The working directory only affects the Stage's command;
# all inputs and outputs of the Stage must also have paths relative to the
# project root.
working-dir: .

# The set of Artifacts which the Stage requires to run 'command' above.
inputs:
  # The Artifact path. All paths are relative to the project's root
  # directory.
  train.py:
    # The checksum of the artifact's contents, written during 'dud commit'.
    checksum: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890

# The set of Artifacts which are owned by the Stage.
outputs:
  # This is how to define a file Artifact with default options. The colon (:)
  # at the end is still required. You may see 'dud stage gen' include empty curly
  # braces ({}) after the colon; this is equivalent to the below.
  model.pkl:
  tensorboard:
    # 'is-dir' tells Dud to expect this Artifact to be a directory, not a file.
    # Defaults to false when omitted.
    is-dir: true

    # 'disable-recursion' tells Dud not to recurse directories when operating on
    # this directory Artifact; all sub-directories will be ignored. Defaults to
    # false (applies recursion) when omitted. Not applicable for file
    # Artifacts.
    disable-recursion: true

  metrics.json:
    # 'skip-cache' tells Dud not to commit this Artifact to the cache. Dud will
    # still write a checksum for this Artifact during 'dud commit', and it will
    # use the checksum to inform other actions, such as 'dud run'. This is useful
    # for declaring Stage outputs which can be safely stored in source control
    # rather than Dud. This option is implicit for Artifacts in 'inputs'.
